Task: Implement combined scoring function

Output:
def combine_sentiment_scores(
    text_sentiment,

    """
    Combines text, thread, and reaction sentiment scores using a weighted average.

    This function calculates a single, unified sentiment score by taking into account
    the sentiment of the content itself, the conversational context (thread), and
    explicit user feedback (reactions). Each component is assigned a weight to
    determine its influence on the final score.

    Args:
        text_sentiment (float): The sentiment score of the primary text,
                                typically from -1.0 (very negative) to 1.0 (very positive).
        thread_sentiment (float): The average sentiment score of the surrounding
                                  thread or conversation.
        reaction_sentiment (float): A sentiment score derived from user reactions
                                    (e.g., likes, dislikes, emojis).
        text_weight (float, optional): The weight assigned to the text_sentiment.
                                       Defaults to 0.5.
        thread_weight (float, optional): The weight assigned to the thread_sentiment.
                                         Defaults to 0.2.
        reaction_weight (float, optional): The weight assigned to the reaction_sentiment.
                                           Defaults to 0.3.

    Returns:
        float: The final combined sentiment score.
